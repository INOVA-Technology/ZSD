# TODO

 - Don't call `exit` in `Game::win_game`. Set a status and check for it in `main`.
   - `Win`, `GameOver`, and `Playing`?
 - Give xp
 - Combos
   - Unlock combos at certain waves
   - Add more
 - Add ability to upgrade kick and punch (and combos? Maybe not...)
 - Add a way to save/restore the game (~/.zsd_save?)
